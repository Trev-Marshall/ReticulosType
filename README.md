# ReticulosType

If you are here to learn new words and get faster at typing then you have come to the right place!

## Where to play..

You can go ahead and access the site (here)[http://trevor--marshall.com/reticulos-type/typing-index.html "Live code"] if you don't want to download the files!

## How to run..

-   Download the files right up there in the corner.
-   Open up the index.html file in a brower of your choice.
-   Start learning and typing! It's as easy as that.

**Note**: The API buffers for a second before the next line comes up. I will be back to send out an update to fix that.

Cheers!
